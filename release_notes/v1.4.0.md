# Release Notes for Lunchy v1.4.0

This release introduces a new pay reminder feature, where when a poll closes, the bot will send a reminder message to users who have not reacted to the poll summary within the `reminder_delay`.

 It also introduces a new command for adding a "no answer" option to polls. This allows users to explicitly indicate they are not participating in it.
