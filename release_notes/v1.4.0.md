# Release Notes for Lunchy v1.4.0

This release introduces a new pay reminder feature, offering the following configuration options to manage payment reminders after a poll has closed:

```yaml
paying_feature:
  enabled: true  # Enable or disable the payment reminder feature.
  emoji: "ðŸ’¸"    # The emoji used to confirm payment on the closed poll summary. Paid users react with this emoji.
  auto_send_emoji: true # Automatically react to poll summary message with the payment confirmation emoji.
  reminder_delay: "1h" # The time after which unpaid users will be reminded to pay. Examples: "30m", "1h", "24h", "7d".
```

When a poll closes, the bot waits for users to react to the poll summary. If the user does not react to the summary within the `reminder_delay`, they will receive a payment reminder mention.
